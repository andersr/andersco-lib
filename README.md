# @andersco code lib 

This is a library of code I use in multiple apps.  It includes React components and hooks, utility functions, and more.


## Development
- Run `yarn build:watch` in one terminal if updating components.
- Run `yarn dev` to run the sandbox dev server.

## Testing
- Component testing dev: `cy:comp:dev`
- Run component tests: `cy:comp:run`

## Build for dist 
- `yarn build`

## Publish package
- TBD
